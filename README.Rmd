A fast general purpose date/time converter written in Rust with crates [dateparser](https://github.com/waltzofpearls/dateparser) and [chrono](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono).

## Installation

You can install the development version of timeless like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("schochastics/timeless")
#or
pak::pak("schochastics/timeless")
```

~~the package is also available on CRAN~~

```r
#install.packages("timeless")
```

**The fix I submitted for [#22](https://github.com/schochastics/timeless/issues/22) was apparently not sufficient and the package was archived.**

```{r}
library(timeless)
```

## Formats

timeless understands many different date(time) formats out of the box. A subset is included as a small benchmark dataset.
```{r}
bench_date
```

`chronos()` is the powerhouse of the package and tries as hard as possible to parse every input into either
a date or a datetime, depending on `out_format`. The function can also return a raw character vector which can be fed into faster
converters, such as [fasttime](https://github.com/s-u/fasttime).
```{r}
chronos(bench_date, out_format = "datetime")
```
## Functions

Under the hood `chronos()` calls three functions which can also be used in isolation:

- `parse_datetime()`: a fast datetime parser that tries several different formats until it can parse the input

- `parse_date()`: a fast date parser that tries several different formats until it can parse the input

- `parse_epoch()`: a fast-ish epoch timestamp parser

## other packages

[anytime](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime) is the most accepted general purpose date(time) converter.

It does not recognize all accepted formats of `timeless` out of the box. (Note that the unrecognized formats can be added via `anytime::addFormats()`)
```{r}
sum_na <- function(x) sum(is.na(x))
sum_na(dplyr::coalesce(
    anytime::anytime(bench_date),
    anytime::anydate(bench_date)
)) / length(bench_date)
```

The list of formats supported out-of-the-box can be retrieved with `anytime::getFormats()`.
`timeless` implements these formats natively too.

Concerning runtime, `timeless` seems to be quite a bit faster than `anytime`.
```{r}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
    chronos(bench_date),
    anytime::anytime(bench_date)
)
```

See [this benchmark](https://github.com/schochastics/timeless/blob/main/data-raw/benchmark.md) for more details.

**Disclaimer**:  
While it might seem that `timeless` has an edge over `anytime`, it is far less battle tested and
mature. Date parsing can be very tricky. I am grateful for everyone who can take the package for a spin and report issues.
